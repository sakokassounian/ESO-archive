# ESO-archive
This script extract raw and processed spectroscopic metadata and downloads the required files ( http://archive.eso.org/cms.html ). The ESO archive is not organized in an efficient way to match processed and raw data. These scripts will do that for you and download the raw files which don't have any processed files.
Follow the steps in the jupyter notebook and later you can automatically run the script from the spectra
